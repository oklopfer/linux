Subject: arm64: dts: rk3399-pinephone-pro: reduce thermal limits

While this device uses the rk3399 it is also enclosed in a tight package
and cooled through the screen and back case. The default rk3399 thermal
limits can result in a burnt screen.

These lower limits have resulted in the existing burn not expanding and
will hopefully result in future devices not experiencing the issue.
