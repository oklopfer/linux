Subject: arm64: dts: rk3399-pinephone-pro: improve sound device definition

This commit renames the sound card and the "Headphone" widget so they
match the names used by the ALSA UCM profiles.

It also adds a jack detection GPIO to the sound card definition, and
creates a new set of ADC keys for handling headset buttons.
